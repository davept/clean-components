# clean-components

Simple components I can use instead of monolithic frameworks.

## Sources / Influences

* Tab component originally based on: [alligator.io](https://alligator.io/react/tabs-component/)
* Scroller from [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16688545/scroll-div-over-another-div)

## Todo

* Create better "menu" / demo page showing off things...
* Checkbox multi select in expander.
* Responsiveness: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive

* Media queries:

// Small devices (landscape phones, 576px and up)
@media (min-width: 576px) { ... }

// Medium devices (tablets, 768px and up)
@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

// Large devices (desktops, 992px and up)
@media (min-width: 992px) { ... }

// Extra large devices (large desktops, 1200px and up)
@media (min-width: 1200px) { ... }

* Components to add:
  - 4 image panels, responsive (4 full width, 2 by 2, 1 wide)
  - Video card - image, category, title, instructor
  - video player embedded
  - 3 column panel
* Change shrink header to be "transparent" with image underneath, text floating.  Then becoming opaque.
* Add images, etc (other components) to parallax scroller!
