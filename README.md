This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# clean-components

Simple components I can use instead of monolithic frameworks.

## Sources / Influences

* Tab component originally based on: [alligator.io](https://alligator.io/react/tabs-component/)
* Scroller from [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16688545/scroll-div-over-another-div)

## Todo

* Change shrink header to be "transparent" with image underneath, text floating.  Then becoming opaque.
* Add images, etc (other components) to parallax scroller!
